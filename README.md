# Pacman Q-Learning

This project implements a Q-learning agent for playing the Pacman game. The Q-learning agent learns to make decisions in the game environment through reinforcement learning.

# Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the Pacman Q-Learning code.

# Prerequisites

- Python 3.5+
- Pygame
- Matplotlib

# How to Run
 ## Step 1: Download and Unzip the project file
    - Dowmload the "zip" file.
    - Extract the contents of the "zip" file to a directory of your choice.

 ## Step 2: Navigate to the project Directory
    - Use "cd {actual path where you extracted the zip file}" to get into the directory of project 

 ## Step 3: Install Dependencies 
    - Ensure you have Python 3.5+ intalled.
    - Then Install the required dependecies using pip 
    - use "pip install pygame matplotlib" to install required dependencies.

 ## Step 4: run Game
    - Run PacmanQ.py to start the Pacman Q-Learning code.

 ## Step 5: Observe Training and Gameplay
    - Observe the training process and pacman agent playing the game.
    - The window should display the Pacman game, and you can watch as the Q- Learning agent learns and plays.

 ## Step 6: Customise Parameter
    - If desired, you can customise the Q-learnign agent's parameter such as alpha, epsilon and discount by modifying the 'QLearningAgent' class in the PacmanQ.py

 ## Step 7: Save and Load Q-Values
    - The Q-values learned by the agent can be saved and loaded using the save_qvalues and load_qvalues methods in the QLearningAgent class.
 
# Additional Notes: 
 - Ensure that your Python installation is in your system's PATH to execute the commands from any location.
 - If you encounter any issues during the installation or execution, check the error messages for guidance. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully set up and run the Pacman Q-Learning code on your machine.
